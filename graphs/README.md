# Graph

### create a Graph .

## Challenge

### create a graph class that have some methods such as : addVertex + getVertex + getNeighbors and size . 

## BigO

- addVertex() -> space:O(1) we did't declared any variables in memory & time:O(1) there is no looping or code repeating .

- addDirectedEdge() -> space:O(1) we did't declared any variables in memory & time:O(n) because we use the has method than will search for specific vertex

- getNodes() -> space:O(1) we did't declared any variables in memory & time:O(1) there is no looping or code repeating .

- getNeighbors() -> space:O(1) we did't declared any variables in memory & time:O(n) because we use the has method than will search for specific vertex

- bfg() -> space:O(n) because we declared N of variables inside the loop & time:O(n^2) because we use nested loop each loop will take N time
